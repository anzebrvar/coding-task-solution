# Coding task solution

The solution is written in Python2, so you can run it with

    python check_scheduled_time.py 16:10 < input.txt

This solution is using a while loop to iterate over minutes
from the time passed as a parameter until the solution is
found and then printed to stdout.

Possible extensions/improvements:
 - error handling (invalid scheduler config)
 - hour parameter validation
 - bulk run
